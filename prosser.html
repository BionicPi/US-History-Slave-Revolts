        <p>Gabriel Prosser was born a slave in Virginia, a literate blacksmith with presently unidentified family. 
<br>
Inspired by the French, Haitian, and American revolutions of the enlightenment, he organised hundreds of supporters for a plan to eliminate all whites in richmond, excluding those of peaceable religions, as to form the Kingdom of Virginia with himself at its head. 
<br>
He was betrayed to the authorities, who had time to prepare for the rising. Upon discovering this, he and some supporters fled to the countryside and eventually Norfolk, where he was again betrayed for the reward. 
<br>
He was returned to Richmond for trial, and was quickly found guilty and executed.</p>
